        <p>Pure and Natural Chebe Oil made with authentic Chebe powder from The Republic of Chad in Central Africa. Chebe (pronounced shea bay) powder is a traditional hair growth remedy from Chad, Africa. It has been used for generations to increase hair growth and prevent breakage. All natural, and only available from plants in this remote part of Africa. M-P410 Chebe is the secret to very long hair in Chad. In Chad women's hair often goes past their waist. For African women elsewhere, this length of hair is almost never seen.</p>
